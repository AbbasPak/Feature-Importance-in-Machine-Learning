## üìå What is Feature Importance?

Feature importance refers to techniques used to determine the impact of individual features (variables) on the predictions made by a machine learning model. Understanding feature importance helps:
- Build more interpretable models.
- Perform effective feature selection.
- Extract meaningful insights from data.

## ‚ùì Why is Feature Importance Important?

- **Improved Model Performance:** Identify and remove irrelevant or redundant features.
- **Model Explainability:** Understand which features drive predictions.
- **Business Insights:** Derive actionable information from your data.

## üîç Methods for Measuring Feature Importance

This repository covers various methods, grouped into the following categories:

### 1. **Model-Based Methods**
   - Gini Importance (Mean Decrease in Impurity)
   - Coefficients from Linear Models
   - Built-in Feature Importance in Tree-Based Models (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM)

### 2. **Permutation Importance**
   - Model-agnostic method to evaluate importance by shuffling feature values.

### 3. **SHAP and LIME**
   - SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
   - LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

### 4. **Statistical Methods**
   - Correlation
   - Mutual Information

## üíª Code Examples

You‚Äôll find example implementations for each method in the `examples` folder. These examples are written in Python using popular libraries such as:
- Scikit-learn
- SHAP
- LIME
- XGBoost / LightGBM

### Example Scripts:
- `tree_based_importance.py`: Feature importance using decision trees and random forests.
- `shap_example.py`: SHAP values for feature interpretation.
- `permutation_importance.py`: Permutation-based importance.
